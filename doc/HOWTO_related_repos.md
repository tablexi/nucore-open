# Branches and Related Repositories

NUcore is usually deployed from a school-specific repo containing customized branding
and functionality. There are situations where you may need to bring changes
from the `nucore-open` repo into a school-specific repo, or the other way around.
In order to move commits between the repos you'll need to set up remote
repositories on each side.

## Bringing changes from `nucore-open` into a school-specific repo

You can bring over all the new changes with a `latest_from_open_MMDDYYYY` branch,
or just a few commmits with a cherry-picked branch.

### General process

1. Start in the directory of the school repo (for example, `nucore-nu`)
1. Open a new branch, either`latest_from_open_MMDDYYYY` or cherry-picked [(see below)](#creating-a-latest_from_open_mmddyyyy-branch)
1. Merge the PR (not squash) once it has been approved and CI is green [(see below)](#squash-vs-merge)
1. For a production release, create a Github release [(see below)](#creating-a-github-release)
1. Deploy the new code using capistrano or helm/CircleCI [(see below)](#deploy)
1. Run any relevant rake tasks
1. Go to staging and confirm new functionality is there

## Creating a branch with cherry picked commits
You can cherry-pick commits from `upstream`/`nucore-open` to create more focused PRs.
This can be useful for features that have more risk or dependencies and should be deployed
and tested separately (ruby upgrades, etc).  In the school repo (for example, `nucore-nu`):
```
git co -b upgrade_ruby_2_6_6
git fetch upstream
git cherry-pick XXXXX
```

## Creating a `latest_from_open_MMDDYYYY` branch

_While in your school-specific repo's directory_

1. Add a new remote called `upstream ` that points to the `nucore-open` repo
(you should only need to do this once): `git remote add upstream git@github.com:tablexi/nucore-open.git`
1. Create a new branch with the name `latest_from_open_MMDDYYYY` (reflecting the current date).
1. Whenever you want to bring the latest changes from open/master into your branch: `git fetch upstream` and then `git merge upstream/master`
1. Run [`bin/merge_describer`](bin/merge_describer) which generates a helpful description you can copy/paste into your PR.  It contains the commit messages and links to the merged branches since the last merge to master.  You can also pass in other branch names or tags to target for the comparison.
1. Push up your new branch to GitHub, and paste the output from `bin/merge_describer` into the PR description.  For clarity it's best to sort commits into 3 groups: features, fixes, and tech tasks.

### Notes

You can use the [`bin/latest_from_open`](bin/latest_from_open) script to create a new `latest_from_open_MMDDYYYY` branch instead of using the steps above.  Add the `upstream` remote, then run `bin/latest_from_open 04012021`.

When merging in changes from the open source repo, differences in `scehma.rb` and `Gemfile.lock` tend to be the trickiest to resolve.  Run `bundle` and `rails db:migrate` locally to ensure any conflicts have been resolved as expected.

## Squash vs Merge

On github, squash commits include a parenthesized branch number like `(#45)` in the commit message by default, except when the PR only includes 1 commit. Merge commits do not include the branch number.
The `bin/merge_describer` script only describes commits which include the parenthesized branch number,
so use Squash (and make sure the parenthesized branch number is in the commit message) for every PR that should be described later on in the GitHub release and release ticket.  Use Merge commits for `latest_from_open_MMDDYYYY` branch PRs.

For feature PRs, the PR description will become the squash commit message. These appear later in the `bin/merge_describer` output, which is used in the`latest_from_open_MMDDYYYY` PR description, github release, and release redmine ticket. Try to write feature PR descriptions that focus on user outcomes rather than technical details - "Fix ability to download CSV" is preferred over "Resolve issues with JSON parsing".

## Creating a GitHub release

1. Check out the commit you want to release and tag it: `git tag v2021-02-18`
1. Use `bin/merge_describer v2021-01-28` to list all commits since the previous release tag
1. Organize the output into features, fixes and tech tasks
1. Create a new release in Github using this list of commits for the description
1. Specify the new tag (`v2021-02-18`) for the release tag version, target, and release title

# Bringing changes from your school-specific repo into `nucore-open`

_While in the `nucore-open` directory_

For example, to bring changes from `nucore-nu` into `nucore-open`:

`git remote add nu git@github.com:tablexi/nucore-nu.git`

The best way to bring in the changes from NU is by cherry-picking the individual
commits. For this reason, it's best to develop on `nucore-open` to start with, or to squash
the commits in your branch so you only need to bring one commit.

```
git fetch nu
git cherry-pick XXXXX
```

# Deploy

## Helm deploy steps

### To staging:

Merging to `master` will trigger a stage deployment.

### To production:

Approve the CircleCI job to trigger a production deployment.

## Capistrano deploy steps

### To staging:

From the root of your school-specific repo:

- `bundle exec cap [staging_name] deploy`

`staging_name` should be `stage`, `staging`, or `development`.  Check the name of the `.rb` files in `config/deploy/[staging_name].rb`.

### To production:

Prod releases need to be scheduled ahead of time with each school, and are typically done after hours.

From the root of your school-specific repo:

- `REVISION=[tag_to_release] bundle exec cap [prod_name] deploy`

`prod_name` should be `prod` or `production`. check the name of the `.rb` files in `config/deploy/[prod_name].rb`.
`tag_to_release` should be created in Github, for example `v2021-03-01`.
