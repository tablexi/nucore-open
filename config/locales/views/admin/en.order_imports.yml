        instructions: |
          <p>Bulk imports are done using a CSV formatted file (from Excel, save as “CSV (Comma delimited)”). The required fields are defined in the template, downloadable below.</p>
          <p>To upload the completed CSV file, click the "Choose File" button to select the file and then click the "Import" button to add the orders to your !facility_downcase!.</p>
          <p>By default, if import errors occur the valid entries are imported and the failed entries are returned in a CSV file for you to correct and upload later.
          If you prefer to halt the import process entirely when any import error occurs (allowing you to correct the file and try again), then check the "Halt import on error" box.</p>
          <p>By default receipts are NOT sent to customers for bulk imported orders. If you would like receipts to be sent to customers check the "send receipts" box.</p>
