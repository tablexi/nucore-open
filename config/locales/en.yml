          You should only update this journal after receiving confirmation of a successful or failed journal from
          NU Financials.  If the journal was processed successfully without any changes, you may choose "Succeeded, no errors".
          This will mark all orders included in the journal as reconciled and you will be unable to make any further changes to them.</p>
          <p>
          If the journal succeeded, but if pricing or payment source changes were necessary to one or more orders
          or if one more more orders were removed from the journal for the journal to succeed, choose "Succeeded, with errors".
          This will mark the journal as successfully, but you will need to reconcile the orders individually.</p>
          <p>If the journal failed, you may choose "Failed".  This will allow you to include all orders in a new journal.</p>

          "Import" to add the orders to your facility.</p><p>By default all valid orders are saved and no receipts are sent to customers. Any
          encountered errors are returned in a CSV file for you to correct and upload later. If you would like an error to halt the import process
          entirely and not save any order information then check the "save nothing on error" box. If you would like receipts to be sent
          to customers check the "send receipts" box.</p><p>For easy order entry we suggest using a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft
          Excel to edit the import template. Once finished with entry simply "save as" a .csv file and then try to upload.</p>
